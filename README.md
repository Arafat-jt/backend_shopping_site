To install Python on your machine go to https://python.org/downloads/.

### 2. Django

Django can be installed easily using pip.

In the command prompt, ensure your virtual environment is active, and execute the following command:

```
py -m pip install Django
```

Otherwise they wom't return no data(possibly throw errors & not run)
