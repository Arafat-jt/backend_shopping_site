## Requirements

### 1.Python == 3
Django is a Python web framework, thus requiring Python to be installed on your machine. At the time of writing, Python 3.8 is the latest version.

To install Python on your machine go to https://python.org/downloads/.

### 2. Django == 3.1

Django can be installed easily using pip.

In the command prompt, ensure your virtual environment is active, and execute the following command:

```
py -m pip install Django
```

### 3. MongoDB == 4.4.3
Mongodb is required as the functions written are made to work on the MongoDB collections

Otherwise they wom't return no data(possibly throw errors & not run)

Download and install MongoDB for Windows: https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-4.4.4-signed.msi
